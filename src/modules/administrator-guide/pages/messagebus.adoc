= Messagebus

The messagebus feature allows the *producer* instance to offload some work to a *consumer* instance via message queues.
Message bus is primarily designed to be used with workflows, but it can be extended to work elsewhere.

//Editor's note: make sure to delete the above (or do it) before it goes out to the public.

[NOTE]
====
A messaging queue is valid when it has defined a name or a consumer.
====

== Queue consumers

Messaging queues are described with a producer-consumer pair.

{PRODUCT_NAME} currently supports two different consumers; store and eventbus.

[NOTE]
====
Consumers are defined in the administration area, where the producers are implemented on the system level.
====

== Listing messaging queues

.To list current messaging queues:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. optionally insert the filtering parameters.
. The list refreshes automatically.

== Creating messaging queues

.To create a new messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the "New" button in the top right corner,
. provide the requested data,
. press the "Submit" button.

"Polling changes delay" affects only the producers that use it (mostly store producers that do not subscribe to changes), so you can usually leave it empty.
//what does "polling changes delay" do? Why is it used? What is it? When is it obligatory to fill out? ... - you may want to include answers to (some of) those questions in the "yet to come" explanation.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* explain ^ a bit better.
====
//yes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only define permissions for existing messaging queues.
====

== Messaging queues and editing

.To create a new messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the edit icon next to the messaging queue you wish to edit,
. provide the requested data,
. press the "Submit" button.

== Deleting messaging queues

.To delete an existing messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the edit icon next to the messaging queue you wish to edit,
. click and confirm the "Delete" button.

//the below is just an attempt and I have very little idea about 

=== Queue parameters

*Consumer*

* The consumer parameter defines the destination of the data flow of a particular message queue.
* Consumers need to be implemented and added as an additional adapter in the code. 
* You can learn more in the #developer section - queues consumers. 
//Editor's note: (help? is this even for viewers or is it for me?)

// *Queue name*
// Should be descriptive, short and alphanumeric only
It is best that the queue name is descriptive, short and alphanumeric only.


// *Polling changes delay*
// This is an optional parameter to define the polling time of the producer when it is not feasible to use subscribing to changes.
// Format: golang time.Duration
// Example: _1h90s_, _15s_

// If unsure, leave it empty.

Polling changes delay is a parameter that defines the polling time of the producer.
It is suggested to use it when subscribing to changes is not feasible, therefore affects only the producers that use it (that mostly includes store producers that do not subscribe to changes).
The parameter can usually be left empty.
The format of polling changes delay is golang _time.Duration_, for example _1h90s_, _15s_.
