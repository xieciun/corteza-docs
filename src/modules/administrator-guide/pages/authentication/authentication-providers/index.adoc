[#idp-roles]
= Adjusting user's role membership

Each of the external authentication provider supports restricting and adjusting user's role membership when a specific external authentication provider is used.

[#idp-roles-permitted]#<<idp-roles-permitted,Permitted roles>>#::
list of roles that users are allowed to keep.

[#idp-roles-prohibited]#<<idp-roles-prohibited,Prohibited roles>>#::
list of roles that are removed from user.

[#idp-roles-forced]#<<idp-roles-forced,Forced roles>>#::
list of roles that are added to user when authenticating with this external provider.

When using in combination with security settings on authentication client, settings from the authentication client are applied first, then settings from external authentication provider.
